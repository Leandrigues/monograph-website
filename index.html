                <p class="description">Serverless services can be defined as a specific type of service where the server
                    infrastructure is hidden from the developer and incurs costs only by usage. In this model, a cloud
                    platform is responsible for dealing with provisioning, managing and maintaining the infrastructure
                    on behalf of the server, so that the developers are responsible for plugging the business code into
                    this structure. However, there is still a gap in the area of understanding and formalizing
                    serverless architectures. A useful way to structure architectural decisions is to adopt a set of
                    patterns and build a pattern language.</p>
                <p class="description">In order to help developers identify the most appropriate patterns to use, we aim
                    to identify and characterize these patterns and its relationships in a pattern language. To do so,
                    we filtered patterns we found, both in gray and white literature, choose the relationships to be
                    used, analyzed which and how the patterns relate. After performing these steps, we had as result our
                    pattern language and also created a website to expose it to practitioners.
